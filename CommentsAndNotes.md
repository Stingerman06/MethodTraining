This file is strictly for commenting on any part of the code in Program.cs. This is also notes for me on possibly improving my code if at all(more than likely).

Added much more functionality to the code. Still missing a few more key features in the program, but I think it's fine as-is. Missing checks for some inputs. Input can be done in more than one way, but this is just the limits of my brain's work. Any more different than it is now and my brain will probably hurt.

The only known functions this program has is reading a file's contents in hex, editing a single byte, and creating a new file(and allows writing to the file. but only 100 bytes worth starting at address 0x00 and this part is native to the program. Never made it possible for the user to change this number. sorry).
